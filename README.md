# Python: Insufficient Exception Handling in Frequent Dictionary Access

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Python that arises from insufficient exception handling when frequently accessing dictionary keys. The bug lies in the lack of robust error handling in a function that accesses a dictionary. The simple try-except block isn't enough if the function is called many times with incomplete data, making the returned 'None' values hard to debug.

## Bug Description
The `function_with_uncommon_bug` accesses a dictionary key that might not always exist.  The current exception handling with `try-except` merely returns `None` if the key is missing. In a larger application where this function is used repeatedly with potentially missing keys, this could lead to unexpected behavior further down the line. 

## Solution
The suggested solution uses the dictionary's `get()` method to provide a default value (0 in this case) when a key is missing, avoiding exceptions altogether and leading to more predictable behavior. This makes the code more robust and easier to debug.
